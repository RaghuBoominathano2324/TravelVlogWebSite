 <h1>Visiting the Taj Mahal: Everything you need to know</h1>   
 <h4 style="font-family: monospace;">written by Bex Shapiro | August 9, 2017</h4>

<br>
<h4 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: small;padding-right: 11%;">Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal?</h4>
</div>
<br>
<div class="midSectionB1">
<p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p>
<br>
<p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than <br>building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing<br> its magnificence up close.</p>
<br>
<p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra,<a style="color: red;text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india"> India </a>between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s<br> the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br>Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br>Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.</p>
<br>
<p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond),<br> and so much more…</p>
<br>
<h1>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h1>
<br>
<p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p>
<br>
<p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p>
<br>
<p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. <br>Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456">8-day Golden Triangle tours </a>(now with solo-only <br>departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India<br> and <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/highlights-india-nepal-143752">Nepal</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from<br> Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while<br> you’re at it, check out their day trips in <a style="color: red;" href="https://www.urbanadventures.com/en/delhi">Delhi</a>,<a style="color: red;" href="https://www.urbanadventures.com/en/asia"> Jaipur</a>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Varanasi </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mumbai</span>!
 </p>
 <br>
 <img style="padding-left: 0%; justify-content: center;  align-items: center;width: 85%;" src="lady_2.png" alt="lady vlogger with indians">
 <br>
 <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally<br> prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>
 <br>
 <h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-size: large;">What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h3>
 <br>
 <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br>minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p>
 <br>
 <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p>
 <br>
 <ul style="list-style: square;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;padding-left: 5%;">
<li>Passport</li>
<br>
<li>Money</li>
<br>
<li>Water</li>
<br>
<li>Medicine</li>
<br>
<li>Camera</li>
<br>
<li>Phone</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h3>
<br>
<p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br>need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.</p>
<br>
<p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear <br>sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</p>
<br>
<p>If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid <br>the worst of the heat.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>
<br>
<div class="qutationDiv">
<img style="width: 2%;height: 2%;" src="qutation_icon.png"> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="font-family:cursive;padding-top:1%;  font-weight:lighter;color: gray;">Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are <br>easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are<br> to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of<br> laces are hard!</p>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Other things you need to know</h3>
<br>
<p>No food is allowed inside.</p>
<br>
<p>Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.</p>
<br>
<p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br> Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small<br> video cameras) are not allowed.</p>
<br>
<p>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br> wits about you and you won’t need to worry!.</p>
<br>
<h3>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3>
<br>
<p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds <br>(if possible).</p>
<br>
<img style="padding-left: 0%; justify-content: center;  align-items: center;width: 85%;" src="TajMahalForignPeoples.png" alt="Forign Peoples">
<br>
<br>
<p>And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly<br> (or more!) remain in awe of it. Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br> some tips on how to do this:</p>
<br>
<div class="qutationDiv2">
    <img style="width: 2%;height: 2%;" src="qutation_icon.png"> &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p style="font-family:cursive;;  font-weight:lighter;color: gray;">The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m<br> done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to <br>make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then <br>they will no longer be surprises!
        The Taj has such a charm.<br> Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the sunlight). It’s so beautiful…</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise<br> on a clear day.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p>
    <br>
    <img style="padding-left: 0%; justify-content: center;  align-items: center;width: 85%;" src="TajMahalTouristPic.png" alt="Tourist sitting for pose">
    <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br>seeking out.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India,<a style="color: red;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/"> Pravin<br> Tamang</a>. (His photography is amazing – <a style="color: red;text-decoration: none;"   
        href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/cities-india-street-photography/">check it out</a>!)</p>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style: square;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;padding-left: 5%;">
        <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
        <br>
        <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main<br> platform</li>
        <br>
        <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
        <br>
        <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
        <br>
        </ul>
        <br>
    <p>ou can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal.<br> Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the<br> day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p>
    <br>
    <img style="padding-left: 0%; justify-content: center;  align-items: center;width: 85%;" src="tajMahalSmog.png" alt="Tajmahal Smog">
    <br>
    <h3>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3>
    <br>
    <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then<br> explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What to do in Agra</h4>
    <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is<br> also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century<br> Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Despite being located on the<a style="text-decoration: none;color: brown;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456"> Golden Triangle</a> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br> many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you <br>likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by<br> (sometimes) taking travelers to <a style="text-decoration: none;color: brown;" href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/sheroes-hangout-cafe-is-run-entirely-by-acid-attack-survivors_n_13830342">Sheroes Hangout</a>. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe<br> run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their <br>stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p>
    <br>

     <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3>
     <br>
     <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these<br>, Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br>and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit<br> it on this <a style="color: brown;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/delhi-kathmandu-143454">15-day trip</a> from <a style="color: brown;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/delhi-kathmandu-143454">Delhi to Kathmandu</a> (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <img style="padding-left: 0%; justify-content: center;  align-items: center;width: 85%;" src="chatrbujTemple.png" alt="ChaturBhujTemple">
     <br>
       <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: lighter;color: grey;font-family: cursive;font-size: smaller;">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</p>
       <br>
       <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the ‘Pink City’, the capital of Rajasthan is full of chaos, <br> charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br>bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home<br> to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy<br> nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on <a style="color: brown;" href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/classic-rajasthan-143698">this 15-day trip</a> all around <br>Rajasthan.</p>
       <br>
       <h3>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h3>
       <br>
       <p>Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white<br> surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work –<br> applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried<br> out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br>carried out on the historic site.</p>
       <br>
